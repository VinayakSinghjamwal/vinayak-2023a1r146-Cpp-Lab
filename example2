mutable example:
int a=0;
a=1;
In CPP, we can make our data immutable using constant , IN Cpp we have constant variables, constant function, constant object.
If we create a variable as constant ,we cannot modify its value after inside function defination.
If we create object as constant , that object will call constant function only. 
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Program{
    public : int b;
    public : Program (const int a)
    {
        b = a;
    }
    void Modify()
    {
        cout<<"\nValue of b is "<<b;
        b = 16;
        cout<<"\nValue of b is "<<b;
    }
};
int main(){
    Program obj(24);
    obj.Modify();
    return 0;
}
